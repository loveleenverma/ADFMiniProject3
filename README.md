# Title: Data Transformation with Azure Data Factory Data Flows: COVID-19 Data Analysis

# Description:
This GitHub repository showcases a data transformation project that leverages Azure Data Factory (ADF) Data Flows to analyze and process COVID-19 data. The project ingests and transforms data from CSV files, including cases and deaths data, and hospital admissions data.

# Key Features:
1. Data Ingestion: The project ingests COVID-19 data from CSV files, including cases and deaths data, and hospital admissions data.

2. Data Transformation: ADF Data Flows perform complex data transformations to clean, enrich, and prepare the data for analysis.

3. Data Analysis: The transformed data is analyzed to derive valuable insights, such as trends, patterns, and correlations related to COVID-19 cases and hospital admissions.

4. Data Visualization: The results of the data analysis are visualized using interactive dashboards or reporting tools, facilitating easy comprehension and decision-making.

5. Scalable and Efficient: ADF Data Flows ensure scalable and efficient data processing, allowing the handling of large volumes of COVID-19 data.

6. Automation and Scheduling: Data transformation and analysis processes are automated and scheduled to run at specific intervals, ensuring up-to-date insights.

By exploring this project, you will gain valuable insights into utilizing Azure Data Factory Data Flows for data transformation and analysis. The provided code, data flows, and visualizations serve as valuable references for similar data projects.

We encourage contributions and customizations to adapt this solution for other data sources or expand it to encompass additional COVID-19 data aspects. Your feedback is highly appreciated to improve the project and enhance its usability.

Unleash the power of Azure Data Factory Data Flows to gain meaningful insights from COVID-19 data and contribute to data-driven decision-making during these challenging times. Happy coding!
